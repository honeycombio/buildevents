// Client represents an object that can create new builders and events and send

// both the package-level libhoney queue and any other client. Clients should be
// created with NewClient(config). A manually created Client{} will function as
// a nil output and drop everything handed to it (so can be safely used in dev
// and tests). For more complete testing you can create a Client with a
// MockOutput transmission then inspect the events it would have sent.
